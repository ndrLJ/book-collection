Book Collection App

Description:
A simple project built with Vanilla JS in order to practice classes, DOM traversal and manipulation.
The purpose was to gain practical experience while doing a JavaScript course. 

This was my first project, and in comparison with my following projects, very little attention went into styling and responsiveness 
as the purpose was to simply create working JavaScript components. In spite of this, it was still a great learning experience and 
I've decided not to modify the original code because I feel it's a good reminder of where I started and what I've learned since then.

However, I do have ideas about how it can be improved. I could connect a database containing books and add the ability to search for books and filter them by genre, writer, etc. 

How to use: 
Press the "Add a New Book!" button, type in the information.
